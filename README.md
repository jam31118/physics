# World Simulation
Various aspect of the world can be modeled as a couple of equations.

Computer extensively enlarges the extent of solvable cases.

# Is it needed? Why?

It is interesting to me. Why?

For example, I want to simulate shock wave, sound from violin, metronome synchronization, and relativistic revision of some of the above mentioned systems etc.

Why do I want to do this?

If one can implement it, one should and will understand it way farther.

Also, it is are interesting to see the animated result. Why is that?
